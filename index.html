            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>I have worked with multiple programming languages to various degrees, including C, C++,
            Python, GDScript, Bash, HTML, CSS and Javascript. Most of the projects made with these
             languages have been either games or websites.</p>
            <h3>Tools</h3>
            <p>I have used tools such as Blender, Asesprite, Photoshop, Pixelmator Pro, DaVinci Resolve
             Studio, Visual Studio Code, Vim, Godot, Unity, Logic Pro and FL Studio for my projects.</p>
            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>My creative projects are most influenced by the works of Toby Fox, Shigesato Itoi, Valve,
            Arsi "Hakita" Patala, Pink Floyd, PixelzwithaZ, PinoPrime, ScottTheWoz, jdh, raxdflipnote,
            Sr Pelo, AZALI, Casiopea, Radiohead, and TomSka among many others.</p>

            <h3>Animations</h3>
            <p>Animation has become the most commonly produced medium on my YouTube channel.
            I've found it to be a great way to implement much of my interests into a neat package.
            Over the summer of 2024, I uploaded many short animated skits made in Flipnote Studio on
            my New Nintendo 3DS. These skits currently stand as the most viewed videos on my channel.
            I have recently however moved over to 3D animated videos. This new style of content comes with a 
            higher production quality than the previous 2D animations and is a more versatile 
            creative outlet with the greater array of features I have at my disposal thanks to Blender's software.</p>
            <p>Here are some examples of the animations I make. More can be found on my YouTube channel.</p>

            <h3>Devlogs</h3>
            <p>My older videos consist of various devlogs of some of my small game projects. These videos
            are all short with little to no narration on them. They were a simple method to show the progress
            of whatever I had been working on.</p>
            <p>Here is a couple of the said devlogs. Like the animations, more can be found on my YouTube channel.</p>

            <p>I have made numerous small game projects over my time developing, although most of them are
            incomplete and kept unreleased. A few however can be found on my GitHub page are are logged on
            my YouTube channel as mentioned above. These projects include "Byte Eversor" and "Return to Earth/Portal 
            Dimensions," though they are closer to being conceptual demos than actual games.</p>
