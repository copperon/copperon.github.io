            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>I have worked with multiple programming languages to various degrees, including C, C++,
            Python, GDScript, Bash, HTML, CSS and Javascript. Most of the projects made with the
            aforementioned languages have been either games or websites.</p>
            <h3>Tools</h3>
            <p>I have used tools such as Blender, Asesprite, Photoshop, Pixelmator Pro, DaVinci Resolve
             Studio, Visual Studio Code, Vim, Godot, Unity, Logic Pro and FL Studio for my projects.</p>
            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>My creative projects are most influenced by works such as Toby Fox's Undertale and Deltarune; Shigesato Itoi's Earthbound/Mother series; Valve's Portal 1&2; Arsi "Hakita" Patala's Ultrakill; Pink Floyd's musical works; PixelzwithaZ, PinoPrime, ScottTheWoz, jdh, raxdflipnote, Sr Pelo, AZALI and TomSka's YouTube content and many more artists.</p>

            <h3>Animations</h3>
            <p>Animation has become the most commonly produced medium on my YouTube channel.
            I've found it to be a great way to implement much of my interests into a neat package.
            Over the summer of 2024, I uploaded many short animated skits made in Flipnote Studio on
            my New Nintendo 3DS. These skits currently stand as the most viewed videos on my channel.
            I have recently however moved over to 3D animated videos. This new style of content comes with a 
            higher production quality than the previous 2D animations and is a more versatile 
            creative outlet with the greater array of features I have at my disposal thanks to Blender's tools.</p>
            <p>Here are some examples of the animations I make. More can be found on my YouTube channel.</p>

            <h3>Devlogs</h3>
            <p>My older videos consist of various devlogs of some of my small game projects. These videos
            are all short with little to no narration on them. They were a simple method to show the progress
            of whatever I had been working on.</p>
            <p>Here is a couple of the said devlogs. Like the animations, more can be found on my YouTube channel.</p>

            <p>I have made numerous small game projects over my time developing, although most of them are
            incomplete and kept unreleased. A few however can be found on my GitHub page are are logged on
            my YouTube channel as mentioned above. These projects include "Byte Eversor" and "Return to Earth/Portal 
            Dimensions," though they are closer to being conceptual demos than actual games. I am currently
            working on continuing the development of PixelzwithaZ's FPS project with the working title of 
            "Not Ultrakill." This project is yet to have a devlog and is not open-source as of now.</p>
